# Next.js Supabase SSR Demo

This is a **Next.js** application integrated with **Supabase** to demonstrate **server-side rendering (SSR)** and **authentication**. It shows how to set up Supabase for user authentication, manage sessions, and perform CRUD operations on a PostgreSQL database. It'll probably do more in the future.

The app uses the `@supabase/ssr` package to handle server-side authentication and session management efficiently.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
